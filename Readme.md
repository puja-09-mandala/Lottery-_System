# Lottery System

## Project Description
Build periodic lottery with ticket sales and winner selection. This smart contract implements a decentralized lottery system on the Aptos blockchain where users can purchase tickets and participate in time-bound lottery draws. The system manages ticket sales, maintains participant records, and accumulates prize pools in a transparent and secure manner.

## Project Vision
To create a fair, transparent, and decentralized lottery system that eliminates the need for traditional centralized lottery operators. Our vision is to provide a trustless environment where participants can engage in lottery activities with complete confidence in the system's integrity, knowing that all operations are governed by immutable smart contract logic.
